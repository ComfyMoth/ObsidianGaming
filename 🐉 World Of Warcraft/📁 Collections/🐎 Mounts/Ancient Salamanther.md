![[Pasted image 20231026213517.png|1000]]
_Due to their preference for dark caves and murky waters, sightings of this unique breed of salamanther are so rare that many researchers thought they had gone extinct._

**Notes**:
This green salamanther, without gills or fins, is a rare drop from most or all of the rare NPCs in the Forbidden Reach.

**Matching Companion Pet(s)**: [[Palamanther]]
