Emerald Bounties are one of the World Events available in the Emerald Dream, in which you nurture a seed with the use of Emerald Dewdrops. 
These drop [[Seedbloom]], which can be used to purchase pets and mounts which are locked by Renown, as well as a transmog set. 
Pets can be purchased after reaching [[Dream Wardens#^fb7424|Renown 11]] Renown 11, and mounts after [[Dream Wardens#^5abe43|Renown 18]].
