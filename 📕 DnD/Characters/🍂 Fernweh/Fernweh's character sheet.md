Positive:
- Helpfull: Fern doesn't shy away from helping others. They prefer it being it for good causes, but money can be dire sometime. They have not shied away from theft before.
Neutral:
- Silent: Fernweh doesn't talk often. Only mostly talking when spoken to. Even then, he speaks sofly, carefully. Picking every word with care.
Negative:
- Closeted: Fern doesn't talk about their past. Attempts that people try to talk about their past are ignored, or subject will be changed.
- No touch: Fern absolutely hates touch, and will not allow it. They shriek away from the smallest touch. They will also not touch other people, only cats are an exception to this rule.

Quirks:
*Satyr Eccentricties: Flowers are the most amazing things ever. I want to pick them, wear them, and discover their silent secrets*: Fern often wears flowers and bits of natures in their hair. It's not uncommon that leafs and sticks are in their autumn-coloured hair.
