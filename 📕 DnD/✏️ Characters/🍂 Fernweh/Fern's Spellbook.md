[Wikibot](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:toll-the-dead) | Xanathar's Guide to Everything
_Necromancy cantrip_

**Casting Time**: 1 action
**Range**: 60 feet
**Components**: V, S
You point at one creature you can see within range, and the sound of a dolorous bell fills the air around it for a moment. 
The target must <span style="color:#f8c48a">succeed</span> on a <span style="color:#33beb7">WIS (wisdom)</span> <span style="color:#f8c48a">saving throw</span> or take `dice: 1d8` <span style="color:#98f2cb">necrotic</span> damage. If the target is missing any of its hit points, it instead takes `dice: 1d12` <span style="color:#98f2cb">necrotic</span> damage.

_**At higher levels**_: The spell’s damage increases by one die when you reach 5th level (2d8 or 2d12), 11th level (3d8 or 3d12), and 17th level (4d8 or 4d12).

*Necromancy cantrip*

**Casting Time**: 1 action
**Range**: 120 feet
**Components**: V, S
**Duration**: 1 round
You create a ghostly, skeletal hand in the space of a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the creature to assail it with the chill of the grave. 
On a hit, the target takes `dice: 1d8` <span style="color:#98f2cb">necrotic</span> damage, and it can’t regain hit points until the start of your next turn. 
Until then, the hand clings to the target. If you hit an undead target, it also has <span style="color:#b4245c">disadvantage</span> on attack rolls against you until the end of your next turn.

_**At higher levels**_: This spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

## Disguise Self
[wikibot](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:disguise-self) | Player's Handbook
*1st-level illusion*

**Casting Time**: 1 action
**Range**: Self
**Components**: V, S
**Duration**: 1 hour

You make yourself – including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person – look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair. To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

## Find Familiar
[Wikibot](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:find-familiar) | Player's Handbook
*1st-level conjuration* ritual

**Casting Time**: 1 hour
**Range**: 10 feet
**Components**: V, S, M (10 gp worth of charcoal, incense, and herbs that must be consumed by fire in a brass brazier)
**Duration**: Instantenous

You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form you choose: bat, cat, crab, frog (toad), hawk, lizard, octopus, owl, poisonous snake, fish (quipper), rat, raven, sea horse, spider, or weasel. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.

Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can’t attack, but it can take other actions as normal.

When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again. As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar to a pocket dimension. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. Whenever the familiar drops to 0 hit points or disappears into the pocket dimension, it leaves behind in its space anything it was wearing or carrying.

While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your familiar’s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.

You can’t have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.

Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.

## Magic Missile
[wikibot](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:magic-missile) | Player's Handbook
*1st-level evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action
**Range** 120 feet
**Components**: V, S
**Duration**: Instantaneous

You create three glowing darts of magical force. Each dart hits a creature of your choice that you can see within range. A dart deals `dice: 1d4 + 1` force damage to its target. The darts all strike simultaneously and you can direct them to hit one creature or several.

_**At higher levels**_: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the spell creates one more dart for each slot level above 1st.
